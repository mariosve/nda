A sophisticated sampler with a multitude of operating modes.

Play Modes:

  • 1-Shot - play the sample once
  • 1-Slice - play current slice once. Which slice to play depends on the setting in "Start slice".
  • Loop - play sample in loop mode from Offset to Loop end, then again from Loop start.
  • Loop p-pong - the same as above, but loop is playing bidirectionally
  • Scratch - playhead is stopped and controlled by Offset parameter. Modulate offset e.g. with oscillators or lfo to scrub through the sample.
  • Pitch - the sample pitch in semitones
  • Speed - bidirectional playback speed. Positive value: play forward from Offset position. Negative value: play backwards from Loop end position.
Time stretching is active if “Stretching” is enabled in the module header menu and if you have set the number of beats in the loop in the “Sync” field.
