Create a short impulse from Gate and Velocity inputs. Impulse shape depends on the Shape setting and the impulse length can be adjusted between super-narrow and up to 50ms. Noise allows you to add noise with the same envelope as the impulse and Tone is a simple 6dB low pass filter to further shape the signal. Useful but not limited to creating excitation impulses for the Modal Resonator, Comb Filter and others.
